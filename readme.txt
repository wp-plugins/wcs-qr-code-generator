This plugin is a QR Code (Quick Response) image generator for mobile tagging.

== Description ==

This plugin is a **QR Code** (Quick Response) generator for **mobile tagging**. It allows you to create one of the ever-popular QR Codes anywhere on a page/post or in a text widget. A **simple shortcode** defaults to generating the 2d code for the current page/post.

Plus, **attributes allow** you to set the: size, color, url (or email, text, phone number, vcard, sms, etc.), tooltip, image format (png or jpg), and error correction level ... along with an option to use a shortened url.

More details are available under *Installation* (above) and at Dashboard->WCS-QR-Code (after activation).

== Installation ==

**Basic Plug-in Usage:**

Install and activate the plug-in. Use the **shortcode** [wcs_qr_code] anywhere in a post/page or in a text widget to generate a QR Code image.

**Standard WordPress installation procedure:**

1. Download the ZIP file to your local computer.
1. Unzip the file's contents.
1. Login as an administrator to your WordPress website.
1. Upload the `wcs-qr-code-generator` directory to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the WordPress Dashboard->Plugins menu.

**Basic Shortcode Usage syntax:**

[wcs_qr_code]

**Example Shortcode Usage:**

[wcs_qr_code **url=**'now is the time' **size=**'128' **color=**'darkblue']

**Shortcode Usage Information:**

1. **url** is the content for the qr code image (defaults to the current page/post url) -- *more on this below*
1. **size** is square image's size in pixels (default is '100')
1. **color** can be a 6-digit hex color value or an HTML color name (default is 'black')
1. **ecl** is the error correction level (default is 'L|4') -- *more on this below*
1. **shorten** is a toggle for shortening the url (default is 'false')
1. **format** is the image format (PNG or JPG) (default is 'png')
1. **tooltip** is the image's tooltip text (default is none)

**ECL Details:**

This plug-in utilizes the Google Charts API. You can view the various ECL settings [here](http://code.google.com/apis/chart/image/docs/gallery/qr_codes.html#details "Google Charts API").

Essentially, the ECL code consists of two components: (1) the error correction level (L, M, Q, or H), and (2) the white border row/column width (1 - 40 rows, not pixels).

**URL Details:**

If omitted, the URL defaults to the current page/post url. You can also use any valid url or text (within the character limitation of the selected ECL attribute value).

When using an **email address**, a standard format is expected. For example **me&#64;here.com** should be implemented as **mailto:me&#64;here.com**.

**Telephone numbers** also have a standardized format. For example, **212-555-1212** should be implemented as **tel:+12125551212**.

An **SMS link** is encoded in a fashion similar to an email address. For example, a link to the number **12345** should be implemented as **sms:12345**.

These and many other possibilities are explained in detail [here](http://code.google.com/p/zxing/wiki/BarcodeContents "2D Barcode Contents").
